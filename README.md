# Hyprland Dot Files
These are my hyprland dot-files and are what I currently use on my main machine.

For guide on the basic system installation see [here](setup.md)
For instructions on how to apply my custom configurations see below.

# Using the dot-files
Download the github repo and peform the following actions:
- Move the Scripts folder to your home directory: `mv Script ~`
- If you already have a `.config` folder in your home directory then copy the contents of the config folder into that folder. If it does not exist then create the `.config` folder in your home directory.
- Move the bashrc to your home directory and rename is `.bashrc` (with the dot)
